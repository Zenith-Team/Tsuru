#### A platform for NSMBU custom code

# Our goal
The goal of this project is to provide a platform for New Super Mario Bros. U custom code for modders with the same toolset that Nintendo developers had when writing the game. We also have provided a ton of code examples and premade patches for new modders to learn from and for people who would just like to use them in their own personal mods. Additionaly, it serves as a unification of multiple code hack projects in order to have a project with everything. All credits linked at the bottom of this readme.
Project started on March 9 2021.

# Contributing
Just create a new Pull Request on the designated page. We will review the PR and accept if we feel that it meets our quality standard and design philosophy. If you have discovered an issue or bug, make an issue on the Issue Tracker. Suggestions may also go there.

# Building
This project is intended to be compiled with the [Tachyon](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tachyon) build system. Keep in mind that currently this project targets version 1.3.0 of the standalone copy of New Super Mario Bros. U, but does maintain compatibility with the DLC as well. Support for the bundle will be coming soon but as of right now it is not our top priority.

# Usage
To install Tsuru onto your game, simply use the [Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.nsmbu.net) patchfile installer, and the latest patch available on the releases page.
